## Coding Challenge

### Please see the problem dataset here:

The dataset is tabular and the features involved are self-explanatory. This is an “open challenge”, mainly focusing on natural language processing. We would like for you to come up with a specific problem yourself and solve it properly. The problem could be either about predictive modeling or providing analytical insights for some business use cases. Note the problem should be treated as large-scale, as the dataset is large (e.g. >100GB) and will not fit into the RAM of your machine. Python is strongly recommended in terms of the coding language.
